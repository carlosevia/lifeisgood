  <title>What is generative AI?</title>

  <shortdesc>Generative AI reads models containing structured data generates
  conversational summaries, images, and suggestions.</shortdesc>

  <conbody>
    <p>While Traditional AI aims to perform specific tasks based on predefined
    rules and patterns, Generative AI goes beyond this limitation and strives
    to create entirely new data that resembles human-created content.</p>

    <p>Generative AI is a subfield of AI that involves creating algorithms
    that can generate new data such as images, text, code, and music.</p>

    <p>The big difference between generative AI and “traditional AI” is that
    the former generates new data based on the training data. Also, it works
    with types of data that “traditional AI” cannot.</p>
